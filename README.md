# OurAnimate-actions-systems
As some of you may know, the legacy video maker has been retired back in 2019 and ever sence then, the drama in the goanimate community has been getting worse and people are creating lvm clones over and over again! This is where ouranimate comes in. Created by captain argonut 24. but the account system for OurAnimate was created by me. The buttons and simular to the css of OurAnimate. OurAnimate brings back the LVM in 2 different types. one is the regular vyond lvm you all love. and the 2nd one is the retro edition of GoAnimate. Used for previewing and retro fun for retro nerds. Well, have fun with the site and contact my discord called joseph the animator#2292 if you are having problems with my OurAnimate Online LVM.
###### UPDATE: this is starting to look like a php legacy video maker clone to use.
## How To Use
that will be coming out soon once the api for ouranimate comes out publicly.
