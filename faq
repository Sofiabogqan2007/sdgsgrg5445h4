<p>This file contains tons of useful information based on questions I get a lot about the project. This file’s a little visually noisy, but feel free to CTRL+F and skim through the headers to find what you want.</p>

<h2 id="about-wrapper-offline">About OurAnimate</h2>
<h3>#1 The Website</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-wrapper-offline">What is OurAnimate</h4>
<p>OurAnimate is a legacy video maker project created by Captain Argonut 24. but i desided to make it 2014 GoAnimate themed and add an account system to it to prevent pornography content from coming into it. the original home page is right <a href="https://captainargonut24.wixsite.com/ouranimate">here</a>.</p>


<h4 id="will-it-work-forever-even-after-flash-is-retired">Will it work forever? Even after Flash is retired?</h4>
<p>Yes it will. just visit this website right <a href="https://josephcrosmanplays532.github.io/adobeFlashPlayerRevival">here</a> and you will find the sources to get it back!</p>


  

<h4 id="wait-chromium-ive-heard-something-about-that-being-a-virus">Wait… Chromium? I’ve heard something about that being a virus…</h4>
<p>Chromium is literally Chrome. It’s the libre software base Google uses to build Chrome, and then they tack proprietary parts like auto-updates and Google integration in so it’s more appealing and they have more control over your experience. Ungoogled-chromium is just a version of Chromium that has any Google integration that’s left in Chromium removed for privacy.
If you don’t trust me, feel free to look through the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium</a>
And these VirusTotal results for it: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection</a>
And you can also see an independent report from this site that analyzes software for spyware traits: <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ungoogled_chromium.html">https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ungoogled_chromium.html</a></p>

<h3 id="using-offline">#2 Using Online</h3>

<h4 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h4>
<p>boi just go on the site</p>


<h4 id="can-i-import-character-ids-from-the-original-lvm">Can I import character IDs from the original LVM?</h4>
<p>Also yes! To do that, go to the matching character creator, and paste <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;original_asset_id=ID HERE</code> at the end of the URL.</p>






<h4 id="file-uploading-isnt-working">File uploading isn’t working!</h4>
<p>Just contact me in my discord called joseph the animator#2292 and i will try to solve the problem and find the cause of it not working.</p>
<h4 id="business-friendly-and-whiteboard-are-missing">Business Friendly and Whiteboard are missing!</h4>
<p>I go into this in more detail in the legalese section, but basically Vyond is still using them so I won’t include them in Online.</p>

<h4 id="watermarks-arent-working">Watermarks aren’t working!</h4>
<p>that might have been becuase you messed up the watermark displaying videos when you downloaded the GoAPI of this project and basicly touched info.json in the static folder.</p>



<h4 id="starters-arent-working">Starters aren’t working!</h4>
<p>that might have been because there is no javascript file that can do that. but soon i will make sure that starters will work for you :)</p>



<h4 id="why-is-business-friendly-missing">Why are you making this lvm clone when you are supposed to be on lvm clone break?</h4>
<p>Because i learned a little bit of js and some functions that i will be able to do. but the tough part is the GoAnimate api. i could not find it in the js cources i did.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Why do you avoid mentioning the original service GoAnimate/Vyond?</h4>
<p>Because they are NOT affiliated or endorsing this project in any form. Wrapper: Offline is and almost certainly always will be a completely separate project. That’s why the full name is simply Wrapper: Offline, and referring to it with that company’s name (such as calling it GoAnimate Wrapper Offline) is wrong.</p>

<h4 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Is this website free?</h4>
<p>Yes it is! just click on signup on the homepage of OurAnimate and you'll be good to go! if you log out, then you will have to logon to your user.
	
<h4 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Why will the heroku api go down alot?</h4>
<p>that's becuase of dymo hours running out & some errors in the npm when i try to fix something.</p>

<h3 id="signup/login">#3 Signup/Login</h3>
<h4>Why do i have to signup and login in order to use OurAnimate Online?</h4>
<p>Well, accrding to TLJRoger on my discord server, he said something about porn videos in Wrapper Online Reborn. so to prevent it happening any further in OurAnimate Online, i created an account system that should hopefully stop this mess!</p>
